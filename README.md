# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

Built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

Used Express to handle routing. 

Deploy the app to Heroku so other users can fill it out. https://young-badlands-29186.herokuapp.com/

The survey has 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

Determine the user's most compatible friend.
Compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question.
The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
  
The modal will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
